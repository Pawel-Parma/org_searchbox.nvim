*searchbox*

Start your search from a more comfortable place, say the upper right corner?

==============================================================================
Introduction                                                 *searchbox-intro*

Searchbox attempts to provide an alternative user experience to the whole
search and replace process, by providing a set UI components. Floating inputs
and menus are used instead of the built-in command-line, hopefully to make the
process more intuitive.

==============================================================================
Search Types                                          *searchbox-search-types*

There are four kinds of search:

incsearch: ~
    Highlights the nearest match of your query as you type.

match_all: ~
    Highlights all the matches in the buffer as you type. By default matches
    will stay highlighted after you submit your search. You can clear them
    with `:SearchBoxClear`. If you want the highlight to disappear after
    the input closes, add the `clear_matches` argument (more on this later).

simple: ~
    Doesn't do anything as you type. No highlight, no moving the cursor
    around in realtime. It's only purpose is to execute a search.

replace: ~
    Starts a multi-step input to search and replace. First input allows you to
    enter a pattern (search term). Second input will ask for the string that
    will replace the previous pattern.

==============================================================================
Usage                                                  *searchbox-basic-usage*

There is a command for each kind of search which can be used in a keybinding.

* Lua Bindings

>
  vim.api.nvim_set_keymap(
    'n',
    '<leader>s',
    ':SearchBoxIncSearch<CR>',
    {noremap = true}
  )
<

* Vimscript Bindings

>
  nnoremap <leader>s :SearchBoxIncSearch<CR>
<

They are also exposed as lua functions, so the following is also valid.

>
  :lua require('searchbox').incsearch()<CR>
<

Visual mode                                    *searchbox-visual-mode-support*

To get proper support in visual mode you'll need to add `visual_mode=true`
to the list of arguments.

In this mode the search area is limited to the range set by the selected text.
Similar to the `substitute` command in this case `:'<,'>s/one/two/g`.

* lua

>
  vim.api.nvim_set_keymap(
    'x',
    '<leader>s',
    ':SearchBoxIncSearch visual_mode=true<CR>',
    {noremap = true}
  )
<

* vimscript

>
  xnoremap <leader>s :SearchBoxIncSearch visual_mode=true<CR>
<

When using the lua api add `<Esc>` at the beginning of the binding.

>
  <Esc>:lua require('searchbox').incsearch({visual_mode = true})<CR>
<

==============================================================================
Search Options                                      *searchbox-search-options*

You can tweak the behaviour of the search if you pass a table with any
of these keys:

reverse: ~
    Look for matches above the cursor.

exact: ~
    Look for an exact match.

title: ~
    Set title for the popup window.

prompt: ~
    Set input prompt.

default_value: ~
    Set initial value for the input.

visual_mode: ~
    Search only in the recently selected text.

show_matches: ~
    If set to `true` it'll show the number of matches in the input. If set
    to a string the pattern `{total}` will be replaced with the number of
    matches. If the pattern `{match}` is found it'll be replaced with the 
    index of match under the cursor. The default format of the message
    is `[{match}/{total}]`. But you can set it to something like this:
    `show_matches='[M:{match} T:{total}]'`. 

modifier: ~
    Apply a "search modifier" at the beginning of the search pattern. It won't
    be visible in the search input. Possible values:
        - `ignore-case`: Make the search case insensitive. 
          Applies the pattern \c.
        - `case-sensitive`: Make the search case sensitive.
          Applies the pattern \C.
        - `no-magic`: Act as if the option |'nomagic'| is used.
          Applies the pattern \M.
        - `magic`: Act as if the option |'magic'| is on. Applies the
          pattern \m.
        - `very-magic`: Anything that isn't alphanumeric has a special meaning.
          Applies the pattern \v.
        - `very-no-magic`: Only the backslash and the terminating character
          has special meaning. Applies the pattern \V.
        - `plain`: Is an alias for `very-no-magic`.
        - `disabled`: Is the default. Don't apply any modifier.
        - `:`: Is a prefix. Use it to add your own modifier to the search.
          Example, `:\C\V` will make the search `very-no-magic` and also
          case sensitive. See |/magic| to know more about possible patterns.

Other arguments are exclusive to one type of search.

                                                 *searchbox.match_all.options*
For `match_all`

clear_matches: ~
    Get rid of the highlight after the search is done.

                                                   *searchbox.replace.options*
For `replace`

confirm: ~
    Ask the user to choose an action on each match. Possible values: 
        - `off` disables the feature.
        - `native` uses neovim's built-in confirm method.
        - `menu` displays a list of possible actions below the match. Is worth
          mentioning `menu` will only show up if neovim's window is big enough,
          confirm type will fallback to "native" if it isn't.

==============================================================================
Command api                                            *searchbox-command-api*

When using the command api the arguments are a space separated list of
key/value pairs. The syntax for the arguments is this: `key=value`.

>
  :SearchBoxMatchAll title=Match exact=true visual_mode=true<CR>
<

Because whitespace acts like a separator between the arguments if you want
to use it as a value you need to escape it, or use a quoted argument. If you
want to use `Match All` as a title, these are your options.

>
  :SearchBoxMatchAll title="Match All"<CR>
<

Or

>
  :SearchBoxMatchAll title='Match All'<CR>
<

Without quotes.

>
  :SearchBoxMatchAll title=Match\ All<CR>
<

Note that escaping is specially funny inside a lua string, so you might need
to use `\\`.

Is worth mention that argument parsing is done manually inside the plugin.
Complex escape sequences are not taken into account. Just `\"` and `\'` to
avoid conflict in quoted arguments, and `\ ` to escape whitespace in a string
argument without quotes.


Not being able to use whitespace freely makes it difficult to use
`default_value` with this api, that's why it gets a special treatment.
There is no `default_value` argument, instead everything that follows
the `--` argument is considered part of the search term.

>
  :SearchBoxMatchAll title=Match clear_matches=true -- My search term<CR>
<

In the example above `My search term` will become the initial value for the
search input. This becomes useful when you want to use advance techniques to
set the initial value of your search (I'll show you some examples later).

If you only going to set the initial value, meaning you're not going to use
any of the other arguments, you can omit the `--`. This is valid, too.

>
  :SearchBoxMatchAll My search term<CR>
<

==============================================================================
Lua api                                                    *searchbox-lua-api*

In this case you'll be using lua functions of the `searchbox` module instead
of commands. The arguments can be provided as a lua table.

>
  :lua require('searchbox').match_all({title='Match All', clear_matches=true, default_value='My search term'})<CR>
<

==============================================================================
Default keymaps                                            *searchbox-keymaps*

Inside the input you can use the following keymaps:
    * `Alt + .`: Writes the content of the last search in the input.
    * `Enter`: Submit input.
    * `Esc`: Closes input.
    * `Ctrl + c`: Close input.
    * `Ctrl + y`: Scroll up.
    * `Ctrl + e`: Scroll down.
    * `Ctrl + b`: Scroll page up.
    * `Ctrl + f`: Scroll page down.
    * `Ctrl + g`: Go to previous match.
    * `Ctrl + l`: Go to next match.

In the confirm menu (of search and replace):
    * `y`: Confirm replace.
    * `n`: Move to next match.
    * `a`: Replace all matches.
    * `q`: Quit menu.
    * `l`: Replace match then quit. Think of it as "the last replace".
    * `Enter`: Accept option.
    * `Esc`: Quit menu.
    * `ctrl + c`: Quit menu.
    * `Tab`: Next option.
    * `shift + Tab`: Previous option.
    * `Down arrow`: Next option.
    * `Up arrow`: Previous option.

The "native" confirm method:
    * `y`: Confirm replace.
    * `n`: Move to next match.
    * `a`: Replace all matches.
    * `q`: Quit menu.
    * `l`: Replace match then quit.

==============================================================================
Configuration                                     *searchbox-general-settings*

If you want to change anything in the `UI` or add a "hook"
you can use `.setup()`.

This is the default configuration.

>
  require('searchbox').setup({
    defaults = {
      reverse = false,
      exact = false,
      prompt = ' ',
      modifier = 'disabled',
      confirm = 'off',
      clear_matches = false,
      show_matches = false,
    },
    popup = {
      relative = 'win',
      position = {
        row = '5%',
        col = '95%',
      },
      size = 30,
      border = {
        style = 'rounded',
        text = {
          top = ' Search ',
          top_align = 'left',
        },
      },
      win_options = {
        winhighlight = 'Normal:Normal',
      },
    },
    hooks = {
      before_mount = function(input)
        -- code
      end,
      after_mount = function(input)
        -- code
      end,
      on_done = function(value, search_type)
        -- code
      end
    }
  })
<
                                                          *searchbox.defaults*
defaults: ~
    A "global config", allows you to set some properties for all inputs.
    So you don't have to declare them using the command api or the lua api.

                                                             *searchbox.popup*
popup options: ~
    They control the popup's settings. Accepts any valid key/value pair
    that a `nui.popup` can handle. For more details refer to `nui.nvim`
    documentation:
    https://github.com/MunifTanjim/nui.nvim/tree/main/lua/nui/popup#options

                                                    *searchbox.popup.relative*
popup.relative: ~
    This option affects how `position` and `size` are calculated.

                                                    *searchbox.popup.position*
popup.position: ~
    Determines in which part of the screen the input should be drawn.

                                                        *searchbox.popup.size*
popup.size: ~
    Controls the size of the popup. If `size` can be a `number` or
    `percentage string`, can also be a table with `width` and `height`.
    Do note input can only have `1` line.

                                                      *searchbox.popup.border*
popup.border: ~
    Contains all border related options like style, text highlight, etc.

                                                 *searchbox.popup.win_options*
popup.win_options: ~
    You can set any variable local to a window (like 'signcolumn').
    See |options.txt|

                                                 *searchbox.popup.buf_options*
popup.buf_options: ~
    You can set any variable local to a window (like 'filetype').
    See |options.txt|

                                                             *searchbox.hooks*
hooks: ~
    Functions that will be executed during the lifecycle of the input.

                                                *searchbox.hooks.before_mount*
hooks.before_mount: ~
    Gets executed before the input drawn in the screen. Receives the instance
    of the input as a parameter.

                                                 *searchbox.hooks.after_mount*
hooks.after_mount: ~
    Gets executed after the input is drawn on the screen. Receives the
    instance of the input as a parameter.

                                                     *searchbox.hooks.on_done*
hooks.on_done: ~
    It's executed after the search is finished. In the case of a successful
    search it gets the value submitted and the type of search as arguments.
    When doing a search and replace, it gets executed after the last
    substitution takes place. In case the search was cancelled, the first
    argument is `nil` and the second argument is the type of search.

==============================================================================
Custom keymaps                                      *searchbox-custom-keymaps*

You can only modify the keymaps after the input is created, means you should
do it in the `after_mount` hook.

These are the actions available in the input.

    * <Plug>(searchbox-close)
    * <Plug>(searchbox-scroll-up)
    * <Plug>(searchbox-scroll-down)
    * <Plug>(searchbox-scroll-page-up)
    * <Plug>(searchbox-scroll-page-down)
    * <Plug>(searchbox-prev-match)
    * <Plug>(searchbox-next-match)
    * <Plug>(searchbox-last-search)

Here is an example. If you wanted to "add support" for normal mode.

>
  after_mount = function(input)
    local opts = {buffer = input.bufnr}

    -- Esc goes to normal mode
    vim.keymap.set('i', '<Esc>', '<cmd>stopinsert<cr>', opts)

    -- Close the input in normal mode
    vim.keymap.set('n', '<Esc>', '<Plug>(searchbox-close)', opts)
    vim.keymap.set('n', '<C-c>', '<Plug>(searchbox-close)', opts)
  end
<

If you are using Neovim 0.6.1 or lower replace |vim.keymap.set()|
with |nvim_buf_set_keymap()|.

>
  vim.api.nvim_buf_set_keymap(
    input.bufnr,
    'n',
    '<Esc>',
    '<Plug>(searchbox-close)',
    {noremap = false}
  )
<

==============================================================================
Examples                                                  *searchbox-examples*

Make a reverse search, like the default `?`:

>
  :SearchBoxIncSearch reverse=true<CR>
<

Make the highlight of `match_all` go away after submit.

>
  :SearchBoxMatchAll clear_matches=true<CR>
<

Move to the nearest exact match without any fuss.

>
  :SearchBoxSimple modifier=case-sensitive exact=true<CR>
<

Add your own modifier to the search pattern. Here we apply `case-sensitive`
and `very-no-magic` together. This makes it so we don't need to escape
characters like `*` or `.`.

>
  :SearchBoxIncSearch modifier=':\C\V'<CR>
<

Start a search and replace.

>
  :SearchBoxReplace<CR>
<

Use the word under the cursor to begin search and replace. (Normal mode).

>
  :SearchBoxReplace -- <C-r>=expand('<cword>')<CR><CR>
<

Look for the word under the cursor.

>
  :SearchBoxMatchAll exact=true -- <C-r>=expand('<cword>')<CR><CR>
<

Use the selected text as a search term. (Visual mode):

Due to limitations on the input, it can't handle newlines well. So whatever
you have selected, must be one line. The escape sequence `\n` can be use in
the search term but will not be interpreted on the second input of search
and replace.

>
  y:SearchBoxReplace -- <C-r>"<CR>
<

Search and replace within the range of the selected text, and look for an
exact match. (Visual mode)

>
  :SearchBoxReplace exact=true visual_mode=true<CR>
<

Confirm every match of search and replace

- Normal mode:

>
  :SearchBoxReplace confirm=menu<CR>
<

- Visual mode:

>
  :SearchBoxReplace confirm=menu visual_mode=true<CR>
<

==============================================================================
Caveats                                                    *searchbox-caveats*

It's very possible this plugin can't simulate every feature of the
built-in search (`/` and  `?`).
